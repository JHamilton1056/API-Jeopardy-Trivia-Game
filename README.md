# API-Jeopardy-Trivia-Game

This project showcased the knowledge learned from my time at Kenzie Academy's 6 month bootcamp. This application uses the Jservice API to query a random category,
folowed by the game prompting the user to asnwer a question. Incorrect aswers will result in a "incorrect answer" message accompanied with a button to allow the 
player to play again. This project displayed the foundational skills I've obtained as well as the logical reasoning required to fit in as an associate front-end
engineer.
